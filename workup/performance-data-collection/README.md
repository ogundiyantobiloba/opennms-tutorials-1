1. What is performance management
    * Measuring insights of system or a device by collecting metrics from an agent
    * Base-line thresholding to ensure measurements are in certain boundaries, low and high thresholds
    * Applying behavioral thresholds when changes between measurements deviate using relative and absolute change thresholds
    * Visualizing in time series graphs in OpenNMS and in Grafana
    * Trending
2. Components involved doing performance data collection
    * Collectd process
    * Groups, System definitions and services
    * Configuration files
    * RRD graph definitions
    * Grafana Dashboards
3. Configure OpenNMS to collect performance metrics from SNMP agents
    * MIB investigation
    * Collecting a scalar OID metric
    * Collecting from a table
    * Collectd configuration
    * Verfying data collection
    * Create RRD graph definitions
    * Create Grafana Dashboards
